# 🚀 Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

To deeply understand the principles underlying machine learning, I decided to build every important ML algorithm entirely from scratch.

That means:
- ❌ No specialized ML libraries
- ❌ No ChatGPT
- ❌ No copy-pasting
- ✅ Just VSCode and my understanding of each algorithm

This repository could theoretically serve as a less optimized but more transparent alternative to libraries like TensorFlow or scikit-learn for the algorithms I've implemented.

## 🤖 Algorithms Included

From simpler to more advanced, algorithms covered include:

1. 📈 **Linear Regression**
2. 📊 **Logistic Regression**
3. 🌳 **Decision Trees**
4. 🌲 **Random Forest**
5. 🧠 **Neural Networks**

# 🔥 Motivation

I'm learning ML to gain a powerful tool toward achieving my primary goal: making **Aging** and **Death** completely **optional**. To get in touch or learn more, check out my website: https://www.eliasschlie.com.
